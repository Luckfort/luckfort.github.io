Bio
======
My name is Jingyuan Huang, an undergraduate student majored in Computer Engineering at Zhejiang University and University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, pursuing double degrees from ZJU and UIUC. During these years, I'm very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Tarek Abdelzaher](http://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/) at UIUC, Prof. [Hongwei Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/hwang) at ZJU, and Prof. [Chao Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/chaoh) at HKU.

Research Interest
======
My research interest mainly focuses on data mining, social recommendation, transfer learning and decision making.
